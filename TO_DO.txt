Dev tasks
- implement UCI
	- assess python<->C to make the string parsing easier :-)
- expand the evaluation function
- 





General Cleanup and analysis
- rename 'struct board' to 'struct position' (to reflect better on its function)
- move to using CMake instead of make
- remove gcc builtin functions (to improve portability)
- assess clang instead of gcc (last time tried, clang 3.7 was 20% slower than gcc 4.8 for move_gen)
- break out the perft and divide into separate functions, to allow running by use of a command-line option
- rewrite the evaluate function to remove the large number of explicit function calls (profile first, to assess impact)
- assess performance of MOVE() 
	- see if moving the score to the upper 32 bits improves performance
